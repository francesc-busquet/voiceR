  recursive = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A character string indicating the path to the folder containing the audio files. Default corresponds to the current working directory.}

\item{fileNamePattern}{Character string indicating the naming format of the audio files, such as "ID-Condition-Dimension", "Condition_ID_Dimension" or "ID". Default corresponds to "ID_Condition_Dimension".}

\item{sep}{A non alpha-numeric that acts as separator between the different naming components. Default corresponds to underscore.}

\item{filter}{Optional character vector used to filter for specific audio files. Default corresponds to NULL.}

\item{recursive}{A logical value indicating whether subdirectories should be included when searching for voice files. Default corresponds to FALSE.}
}
\value{
Character vector, which contains all the unique conditions of the voice files extracted from the name pattern of the audio files.

\description{
Retrieves the experimental conditions from the file name following a naming pattern in which the various components (IDs, conditions, and dimensions) are separated by a non-alphanumeric character.
